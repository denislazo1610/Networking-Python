# Overview

In this programm, I tried to learn how to make a network conenciton between 2 codes (a client and a server). 
The program will start if we start running first the server file. Then, we will be able to make a 
connection by running the client file.

# Network Communication

I created a networking connection between a client and a server.
I attempted to create a TCP, but I ended up having a UDP
A client will be able to sed a message to server, then the server will identify 
where the message come from.


# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code

Socket library. To be able to create sockets so I can create connection.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Be able to make the client to send more messages
* Be ablel to send images from the server to the client
* To be able to the server to talk multiple clients.
